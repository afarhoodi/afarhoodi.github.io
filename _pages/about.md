I am an applied microeconomist and an Assistant Professor of Economics at [University of Toronto](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/person/person/faculty/1936). I work on topics related to urban economics, industrial organization, digital economics, and the spatial distribution of economic activities. My research involves using big-data tools, structural estimation, and machine learning techniques to address economic questions.
